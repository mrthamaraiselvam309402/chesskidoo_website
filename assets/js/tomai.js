   TOM — ChessKidoo intelligent assistant (v2)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Lives in the global CK namespace as `CK.tomai`. Rule-based chatbot
   tailored to the ChessKidoo platform.

   v2 Improvements:
   - Polished detailed knight SVG icon (matches a real chess piece)
   - Unique gradient IDs per instance (so multiple renders don't collide)
   - Robust init (multiple triggers + fallback) so the launcher always shows
   - Context awareness: detects active portal/page and tailors answers
   - Expanded knowledge bank with per-portal commands
   - Better intent matching with synonyms
